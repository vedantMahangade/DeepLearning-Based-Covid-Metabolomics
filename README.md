# DeepLearning-Based-Covid-Metabolomics



## Project details
This project aims to implement a deep learning approach to perform biomarker analysis on metabolite data for COVID-19. Metabolites are small molecules in the body that play a key role in biochemical reactions essential for maintaining cellular functions, producing energy, supporting growth, and responding to environmental changes. Viral influences like COVID-19 affect the body on multiple levels, including significant disruptions in metabolic processes. Disruptions in metabolite levels are closely tied to disease severity and the body's ability to combat infection. Analyzing and comparing these variations across groups could help identify biomarkers for disease severity, which could be key in early detection, prognosis, and even therapeutic interventions for COVID-19.
To achieve this, a neural network model will be developed to analyze metabolite expression and identify important features linked to severity. The model will incorporate regularization techniques to encourage sparsity and highlight significant metabolites while preventing overfitting. Post-training analysis using explainability techniques. will provide insight into the model's decision-making process, allowing for the identification of the most impactful metabolites.
